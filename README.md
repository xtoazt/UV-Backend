# Embeddr: iFrame anything!
## This is a personal version of [Alkali by Technonyte](https://alkali.pages.dev/)

## Have you ever wanted to iFrame a site, just to get this?
![Site deneying Iframe access](https://github.com/LupineVault/embeddr/blob/main/no.png?raw=true)

## Just paste any non-iFrameable url in the box and copy the url! Use that in any iFrame and you're good to go!

### Example:
```
https://embeddr.pages.dev/embed#https://github.com/LupineVault/embeddr
```
